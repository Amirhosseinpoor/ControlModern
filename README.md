# Modern Control — Ball & Beam System

This project focuses on applying modern control techniques to a ball-and-beam system. The goal was to stabilize the ball and achieve accurate reference tracking using state-space methods.

**Key points:**

* Derived nonlinear dynamics and built the state-space model of the ball–beam system.
* Linearized the system around the equilibrium point and verified controllability and observability.
* Designed state-feedback controllers with pole placement and added integral action to remove steady-state error.
* Implemented a Luenberger observer to estimate unmeasured states and enable output-feedback control.
* Simulated both the linearized and nonlinear systems in MATLAB/Simulink, verifying stability, robustness, and tracking performance.

**Tools used:** MATLAB, Simulink

**Outcome:** The designed controller successfully stabilized the system, ensured accurate tracking, and demonstrated robustness against disturbances.
