# Final Project ‚Äî Ball & Beam System

This project applied modern control methods to stabilize and track the motion of a ball on a beam.

**Key points:**

* Derived nonlinear dynamics and converted them into a state-space representation.
* Linearized the system around equilibrium and analyzed controllability and observability.
* Designed a state-feedback controller with pole placement and added integral action to eliminate steady-state error.
* Implemented a Luenberger observer for state estimation.
* Verified stability and robustness by simulating both nonlinear and linearized models in MATLAB/Simulink.

**Tools used:** MATLAB, Simulink

**Outcome:** The designed controller successfully stabilized the ball-and-beam system, achieved accurate tracking, and demonstrated robustness under different conditions.
