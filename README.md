Here’s a clean, professional, and **not excessive** `README.md` draft for your **Modern Control — Ball & Beam** project:

# Modern Control — Ball & Beam System

## Overview
This project implements modern control techniques to stabilize and control a **ball and beam system**.  
The main objectives were:
- Modeling the nonlinear dynamics
- Linearizing around equilibrium
- Designing state-feedback controllers with integral action
- Implementing a Luenberger observer for partial-state measurement
- Verifying performance on both linearized and nonlinear models

---

## Key Features
- **System Modeling**  
  - Derived nonlinear equations of motion for the ball–beam system  
  - Built state-space representation for analysis and simulation  

- **Control Design**  
  - Linearization around the operating point  
  - Controllability and observability analysis  
  - State-feedback via pole placement  
  - Integral action for eliminating steady-state error  
  - Luenberger observer to estimate unmeasured states  

- **Simulation**  
  - MATLAB/Simulink implementation  
  - Step and reference tracking responses  
  - Comparison between linearized and nonlinear system behavior  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- MATLAB  
- Simulink  

---

## Results
- Successful stabilization of the ball on the beam  
- Accurate reference tracking with minimal steady-state error  
- Robustness tested under different initial conditions and disturbances

Would you like me to also prepare a **shorter version** (like 8–10 lines total, no subsections) in case you want a minimal `README` for GitHub?
